## What is HyperCube?

HyperCube is a homebrew computer system designed with hackers in mind.
Everything about the machine is open source, from the CPUs, GPUs, sound modules,
and so on.

## How is it designed?

Primarily, the system is composed of a backplane with a custom point-to-point
bus based around an FPGA. The cores are fully open source and hackable, and the
backplane is fully modular, allowing for CPUs to be plugged in arbitrarily.

The system is expandable with card-edge expansion boards called "modules", and
supports up to eight installed at once.
